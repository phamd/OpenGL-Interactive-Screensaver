Clicking with the mouse will start building a
shape. The first click makes a point; the second
sets the direction. Toggling `m' will let you
click&drag to quickly make points.
Switching modes while in the middle of building a shape
will make the new shape with those points instead.
For fun: add many random shapes, increase vertex speed
and size, then hold b.
